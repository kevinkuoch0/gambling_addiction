						You can't win little Timmy's love from playing slot machines. For every minute you waste pulling that slot machine lever, little Timmy begins to care less and less about the fact that you did not make it to his Piano recital. You are a terrible person, and you should feel bad.

						But fear not, here at Gambler's Anonymous, we are dedicated to helping people to drop the habit and not be a terrible person anymore. We'll help you consolidate and pay off your loans and debts, give you access to addiction counciling, and who knows, we might even sit there in the room with you as you awkwardly attempt to try and repair your horrendously fractured familial relationships that have been brought about from your addiction.
