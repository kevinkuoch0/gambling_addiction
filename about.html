					Who We Are & How We Can Help
					</h2>
					<p class="intro">
						The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) was conceived as the national representative of the problem gambling field and is organized with 3 classes of members: state affiliate, corporate and individual. The NCPG concentrates efforts on the national level, while the state affiliates work at the state and local level.
					</p>
					<p class="intro">
						<span class="bold-uppercase">Purpose:</span> To serve as the national advocate for programs and services to assist problem gamblers and their families.
					</p>
					<p class="intro">
						<span class="bold-uppercase">Vision:</span> To improve health and wellness by reducing the personal, social and economic costs of problem gambling.
					</p>
					<p class="intro">
						<span class="bold-uppercase">Mission:</span> To lead state and national stakeholders in the development of comprehensive policy and programs for all those affected by problem gambling.
					</p>
					<p class="intro">
						<span class="bold-uppercase">Core Values:</span>
						<ul>
							<li class="values"><span class="bold-italic">Neutrality:</span> We do not take a position for or against legalized gambling. We advocate solely for those affected by problem gambling.</li>
							<li class="values"><span class="bold-italic">Collaboration:</span> We believe that our mission is best served by the collaborative action of a broad range of people and organizations.</li>
							<li class="values"><span class="bold-italic">Respect:</span> We will treat all those affected by problem gambling and all stakeholders with respect.</li>
							<li class="values"><span class="bold-italic">Credibility:</span> We will strive to be an objective, accurate and reliable source of information for all those concerned with problem gambling.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="intro">
						<span class="bold-uppercase">History:</span> The organization was founded in 1972 by Msgr. Joseph A. Dunne and Dr. Robert Custer, among others. From the outset the Council established two principles that remain in effect today: that the organization would be the advocate for problem gamblers and their families, and that it would take no position for or against legalized gambling. This stance is encompassed today in our vision and mission statements above. A history of the NCPG from 1972 to 1985 by Msgr. Dunne was published in the Journal of Gambling Studies, Vol. 1, Issue 1.
