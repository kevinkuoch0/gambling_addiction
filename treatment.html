				<p class="intro">
					Like alcohol or drug addiction, pathological gambling is a long-term disorder that tends to get worse without treatment. Even with treatment, it's common to start gambling again (relapse). However, people with pathological gambling can do very well with the right treatment.

						<h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3>
						<p>
							Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy. It works to solve current problems and change unhelpful thinking and behavior. This technique acknowledges that there may be behaviors that cannot be controlled through rational thought, but rather emerge based on prior conditioning from the environment and other external and/or internal stimuli. CBT is "problem focused" (undertaken for specific problems) and "action oriented" (therapist tries to assist the client in selecting specific strategies to help address those problems), or directive in its therapeutic approach.

						<h3>Gamblers Anonymous</h3>
						<p>
							 Gamblers Anonymous, a self-help support group, is a 12-step program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. Gamblers Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other. They strive to solve their common problem and to help others recover from a gambling problem. Practices used to treat other types of addiction, such as substance abuse and alcohol dependence, can also be helpful in treating problem gambling.
